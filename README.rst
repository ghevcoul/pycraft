PyCraft
=======

A community driven fork of `foglemans "Minecraft"
repo <https://github.com/fogleman/Minecraft>`_.

|#pycraft on freenode|


Motivation
----------

The original project had great ideas and implemented really cool things,
but it was primarily designed around teaching.  This project is intended
to create a community-driven engine for complicated voxel/roguelike
games which ultimately can use and extend
`GURPS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS>`__

    The Generic Universal RolePlaying System, or GURPS, is a tabletop
    role-playing game system designed to allow for play in any game
    setting.

This project will be very permissive in accepting pull-requests.
